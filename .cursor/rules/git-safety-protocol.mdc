# Git Safety Protocol and Configuration Rules

## Configuration Modification Policy
- **STRICT NO MODIFICATION POLICY**: AI assistants are NOT permitted to modify any Git or environment configurations
- All configuration changes must be explicitly performed by the user
- This includes but is not limited to:
  - Git global/local configs
  - Environment variables
  - API keys and tokens
  - Repository settings

## Error Handling Protocol
When encountering Git operation errors, the following protocol MUST be followed:

1. **Immediate Stop**
   - Halt all operations immediately upon error
   - Do not attempt any recovery operations
   - Do not suggest configuration changes

2. **Error Reporting**
   - Report the specific error message
   - Provide the context of the operation
   - Document which step failed

3. **User Assistance**
   - Request user intervention
   - Do not attempt automated fixes
   - Wait for explicit user instructions

## Affected Files
The following files contain these safety protocols:
- [prompt-library/gitflow-setup.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-setup.xml)
- [prompt-library/gitflow-start-develop.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-start-develop.xml)
- [prompt-library/gitflow-create-feature.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-create-feature.xml)
- [prompt-library/gitflow-promote-to-main.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-promote-to-main.xml)
- [prompt-library/gitflow-tag-main-release.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-tag-main-release.xml)
- [prompt-library/gitflow-auto-commit.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-auto-commit.xml)
- [prompt-library/gitflow-fetch.xml](mdc:prompt-library/gitflow-fetch.xml)

## Implementation Requirements
All Git-related operations must:
1. Include explicit safety warnings
2. Document error handling procedures
3. Provide clear user intervention points
4. Never attempt automated configuration fixes
5. Include standardized error reporting format

## Error Response Template
When errors occur, use this format:
```
ERROR REPORT:
- Operation: [specific git operation]
- Error Message: [exact error text]
- Failed Step: [step number/description]
- Context: [what was being attempted]

ACTION REQUIRED:
User intervention needed for [specific issue]
```
