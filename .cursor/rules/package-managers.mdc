# Package Manager Requirements

## Python Projects
- All Python projects MUST use UV as the package manager
- Required files:
  - `requirements.txt` for dependencies
  - `.uv` lockfile for version locking
- No other package managers (pip, poetry, pipenv) are allowed
- UV must be configured with optimal settings for dependency management

## JavaScript/TypeScript Projects
- All JS/TS projects MUST use PNPM as the package manager
- Required files:
  - `package.json` for project configuration
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` for version locking
- No other package managers (npm, yarn) are allowed
- PNPM must be configured with optimal settings for dependency management

## Enforcement
- Project initialization must verify correct package manager
- CI/CD pipelines must enforce these package manager requirements
- Development environments must be configured to use UV for Python and PNPM for JS/TS
- Lock files must be committed to version control
