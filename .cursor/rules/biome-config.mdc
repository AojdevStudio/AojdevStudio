# Biome Configuration Requirements

## Mandatory Integration
- Biome is required for all JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- Biome is the sole source of:
  - Code formatting
  - Linting
  - Type checking
- No other tools (ESLint, Prettier, etc.) should be used for these purposes

## Required Configuration
- Project must include `biome.json` with:
  - Formatting rules
  - Linting rules
  - Type checking configuration
- Package.json must include Biome scripts:
  - `"format": "biome format ."`
  - `"lint": "biome lint ."`
  - `"check": "biome check ."`

## IDE Integration
- Editor must be configured to use Biome for:
  - On-save formatting
  - Real-time linting
  - Type checking
- No conflicting formatter or linter extensions should be enabled

## Best Practices
- Biome configuration should follow project-specific best practices
- All formatting/linting rules must be documented
- Type checking must be set to strict mode
- Custom rules must be justified in documentation
