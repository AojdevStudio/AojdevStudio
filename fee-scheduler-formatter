Tab-Delimited Fee Schedule Conversion Project
I need you to convert a dental fee schedule (or similar document) from its current format into a clean, tab-delimited text file with three columns: Code, Description, and Fee.
What I'm uploading:

A fee schedule document (likely in TXT or PDF format)
The document contains procedure codes, descriptions, and associated fees
The format may be inconsistent or difficult to read in its current state

What I need you to do:

Review the uploaded document to identify the structure (codes, descriptions, fees)
Create a tab-delimited file with exactly three columns:

Column 1: Code (e.g., D0120, D2750)
Column 2: Description (e.g., "Periodic Oral Evaluation")
Column 3: Fee (e.g., $38, $702)


Preserve any special notations (such as "#" for bundled services)
Present the final output as a downloadable text file that I can easily import into spreadsheet applications
Notify me when the conversion is complete

Important notes:

Keep all codes and fees exactly as they appear in the original document
Maintain proper alignment and consistent formatting throughout
Ensure that special characters are properly handled
Let me know if you encounter any issues with the source document that need my attention

Please get started as soon as I upload the document. Thanks!
