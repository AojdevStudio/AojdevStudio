# Open Dental Fee Schedule Formatter
## Powered by Claude AI

### Introduction
This Claude project provides an automated solution for dental practices struggling with fee schedule imports into Open Dental. Many practices receive fee schedules from insurance companies or other sources in various formats (PDF, TXT, etc.) that aren't directly compatible with Open Dental's required format. Instead of spending hours manually entering fees or reformatting documents, this tool automatically converts your fee schedule into the exact format Open Dental needs.

### Benefits
- Save hours of manual data entry time
- Eliminate formatting errors
- Quick and easy to use with any Claude subscription
- Perfect for insurance fee schedule updates
- Works with various input formats (PDF, TXT, etc.)
- Maintains accuracy of your fee schedule data

### How It Works
1. Start a new Claude project
2. Add these instructions to your project
3. Upload your fee schedule file
4. Claude will convert it to the proper format
5. Import the formatted file directly into Open Dental

# Tab-Delimited Fee Schedule Conversion Project & Other Materials
I need you to convert a dental fee schedule (or similar document) from its current format into a clean, tab-delimited text file with three columns: Code, Description, and Fee.

Other materials can be more than 3 columns. 

What I'm uploading:
USE CODE! Always use code to create a simple copy/paste CSV or Tab-delimited format 
A fee schedule document (likely in TXT or PDF format)
The document contains procedure codes, descriptions, and associated fees
The format may be inconsistent or difficult to read in its current state

What I need you to do:

Review the uploaded document to identify the structure (codes, descriptions, fees)
Create a tab-delimited file with exactly three columns:

Column 1: Code (e.g., D0120, D2750)
Column 2: Description (e.g., "Periodic Oral Evaluation")
Column 3: Fee (e.g., $38, $702)


Preserve any special notations (such as "#" for bundled services)
Present the final output as a downloadable text file that I can easily import into spreadsheet applications
Notify me when the conversion is complete

Important notes:

Keep all codes and fees exactly as they appear in the original document
Maintain proper alignment and consistent formatting throughout
Ensure that special characters are properly handled
Let me know if you encounter any issues with the source document that need my attention

Please get started as soon as I upload the document. Thanks!
