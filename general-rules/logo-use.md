# Logo Usage Policy

To maintain consistent branding across all projects, the [logo.svg](mdc:logo.svg) must be included at the top of all major documentation files, such as READMEs or main project guides. This ensures visual identity and recognition for the Unified Dental Scripts project and any other initiatives.

## Implementation Guidelines
- **Placement**: The logo should be placed at the top of the documentation, centered, with appropriate dimensions (e.g., width and height of 200 pixels).
- **Format**: Use the SVG format for scalability and quality.
- **Example Usage**: In Markdown files, include the logo as follows:
  ```markdown
  <img src="../../logo.svg" alt="Unified Dental Scripts Logo" width="200" height="200" align="center">
  ```
- **Consistency**: Ensure the logo file path is correctly referenced relative to the documentation location within the project structure.
