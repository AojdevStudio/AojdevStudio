## Enhanced Deep Research Protocol

Another @JeredBlu [https://github.com/JeredBlu/) inspiration these custom instructions create a comprehensive research workflow by combining Tavily MCP, Brave Search, Anthropic's Think Tool MCP, Knowledge Graph, native tools with claude such as analysis tool and artifacts. 
Overview of Enhanced Research Protocol
This protocol transforms systematic research by integrating advanced tools into a cohesive workflow that builds comprehensive understanding through iterative analysis cycles. It replaces traditional sequential thinking with a more dynamic process centered on the Think tool and Knowledge Graph, creating a persistent memory architecture that evolves throughout the investigation. The protocol follows a structured progression through initial engagement, detailed planning, systematic research cycles, and comprehensive reporting.
